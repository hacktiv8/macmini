Mac Mini
========

This is a script to set up an OS X machine, geared for web development.
It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* OS X Mavericks (10.9)
* OS X Yosemite (10.10)
* OS X El Capitan (10.11)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hacktiv8/macmini/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/macmini.log
```


Debugging
---------

Your last run will be saved to `~/macmini.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
}

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
fi

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
}

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
fi

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.

Setting Up Cleaning Script
--------------------------


Open up crontab as root.

```text
> sudo crontab -e
```

Add this line into crontab

`0 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/clean.sh`

to run cleaners exactly on 23:00 every night.

Edit file `clean.sh` and change the `USER` variable to for example `hacktiv8-13` and then copy `clean.sh` file into `/usr/local/bin/clean.sh`.

```text
> cp clean.sh /usr/local/bin/
```

One more, unzip `studentclean.tar.gz` and move it to `/Users/` 

```text
> sudo cp -R studentclean /Users
```
